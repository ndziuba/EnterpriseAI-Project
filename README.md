## ZenML pipeline

### data_loader step
The data_loader step is a part of the training pipeline. It fetches wildfire data from the Canada Wildfire Service(https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/downloads/activefires/activefires.csv), filters it based on a specified timeframe (daydelta parameter), and retrieves satellite images of the wildfires from the Mapbox API. This step mimics the origin of the Kaggle dataset and creates additional training, valid and test data, enabling a continuous change in the model. 

The step returns the count of images saved, which is useful for understanding the volume of data added in each run.

### hp_tuner step
The hp_tuner step tunes the hyperparameters of the model, specifically the number of neuron in the hidden layer we added on top of the original ResNet50 model. First it loads the necessary data and concatenates the additional data we added to the original dataset with the train and validation datasets. After that the Keras tuner starts to build the model. Our model consists of the basic resnet50 model (all the weights of the layers of the pretrained model will be excluded from training), an additional Flatten layer, are Dense layer of variable size and a relu activation function (Rectifier Linear Unit) and at last an output layer for the two classes with a softmax activation function. After building the model, the tuner starts the hp search with the specified amount of epochs for the sizes 128, 256 and 512 of the hidden layer. After the completion of the search, the step returns the optimal model for the current data.

### trainer step
The trainer step further trains the optimal model returned in the hp_tuning step. At the beginning the necessary data for the step is loaded and again concatenatet with our own additional data. The trainer then fits the model for the additional specified amount of epochs

### evaluator step
The evaluator step loads the new model and the current production model and returns the model accuracy on the test dataset respectively.

### bento_builder step
The bento_builder step starts the building of the bento with the new model. It specifies, which data in the repository to exclude from building and which python packages to include in the final bento. Furthermore the corresponding service.py spcifies how the runner should work in production. We configured the bento to get an image as the input and return an array with the confidence of the corresponding class and the model version used to run the prediction.

### discord_alter step
A simple alerting mechanism builds in the pipeline to notify us via our discord of updates. It follows the structure of (https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects/blob/main/nba-pipeline/steps/discord_bot.py). The step takes the deployment decision and the test_evaluation accuracy and uses the discord webhook interface to send the message.

### trigger_decision step
Step comparing the accuracy of the newly trained model and the model currently in deployment and returns a bool.

### Deployer step 
Pushes the last build bento to Yatai, from where it gets deployed into our staging model. It further saves the model to compare its performance in the next iteration. 

## Notebooks

### enrich_data
This notebook used MapBox and geoAPI to enrich the training data with no wildfire pictures from cities with similar geographical makeup as Canada. For each entry in a list of 128 Cities, the geo API is used to gather its coordinates. A random noise of ~ 5 km^2 is added for each coordinate, and the MapBox API is called to generate an image. This gets repeated 50 times per city to add 6400 additional samples to our data. We assume that the images depict cities and their surroundings. We can safely classify them as no wildfire.

Essential steps

  - [X] Find and download (static) data set of your choice
  - [X] Split it into training, validation and test set. Put the test set aside. The test should later be used to "simulate" prediction requests during production.
  - [ ] ~~Perform feature engineering~~
  - [X] Train a ML Model of your choice
  - [X] Evaluate the model using at least one benchmark (see lecture 6)
  - [x] Put the model in production on a server
  - [x] Create an app where users can query predictions from the model
  - [ ] Use the data from your test set to send prediction requests to your model
  - [X] Track all your experiments and code versions in your team (and describe how you did this in your project documentation)

  

Ideas for additional steps (ordered from less to more difficult)

  - [X] Establish procedures for data validation (and document them!)
  - [ ] ~~Test feature importance to identify the most relevant features for your model (see lecture 4)~~
  - [X] Improve your machine learning model, e.g. by performing hyperparameter tuning or by creating an ensemble (see lecture 6)
  - [ ] Include a feature in your app for users to give feedback on the quality of the predictions
  - [X] In case you have little data and/or few labels, apply some data augmentation techniques and/or programmatic labeling techniques (see lecture 4)
  - [ ] ~~Evaluate the fairness and robustness of your model with some of the techniques mentioned in the lecture. For example, conduct a slice-based evaluation, perform perturbation tests (e.g. to simulate an adversarial attack)~~
  - [ ] (WIP m3ndel, evtl. model compression)Optimize your model, to reduce inference latency and/or model size
  - [ ] (Wird manuell möglich sein) Simulate varying traffic levels of prediciton requests. Make your deployment scalable to adapt to the varying levels
  - [x] Simulate a model update in production (e.g. via a shadow deployment, A/B test, a canary release,…)
  - [X] Get access to a data source that is updated over time. Use it instead of using the static dataset mentioned above. Establish the appropiate measures to handle drift by validating the incoming data. Monitor the performance of your model.
  - [x] In the previous setting: Establish a procedure to update your model. 
  - [X] Create a system composed of several ML-based microservices that interact (see modes of data flow in lecture 3)
